I have been writing this code while following this great online tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d&index=1 .

The code makes use of the following React concepts: useState, useEffect,useParams, custom hooks, React Routing, controlled inputs, useEffect cleanup.
Other topics included in the code are: fetch API, JSON server, POST request
